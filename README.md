Data Analytics in Accounting Capstone Project on Lending Club 
This project is a part of Accounting Data Analytics Specialization by University of Illinois USA.
It is also a part of the Master of Science in Accountancy (iMSA) degree.
I completed this specialization by June 12, 2021

In this project, I completed the whole process of the data analytics framework CRISP-DM on the LendingClub dataset. I applied my data anlytics skills on the provided loans dataset to help investors figure out which loans on the Lending Clubâ„¢ are most profitable.
