So our focus is on the precision rate of class 1. From the classification report of the first model, we can see that the precision rate of class 1 is 0.86, or 86%. This means among all the loans identified as to be fully paid by the classification model, 86% of them are actually fully paid. This is a not much better than the repaid rate of the whole test set, which is about 85%. The reason is that the model only has 0.07 recall rate on class 0, which means, for all loans that are charged off, the model only identifies 7% of them as charged off.\n",

In the second model, we set `class_weight='balanced'`. The default RandomForestClassifier is not very senstive to class_weight change, so we also limit `max_depth` to increase the effectiveness of class_weight change.\n",

    "From the classification report of the second Random Forest Classifier, we can see that even though the accuracy rate drops to 65%, the model has a lot larger class 0 recall at 0.44. It means the model identifies 44% of all charged off loans correctly. More importantly, we get better class 1 precission, 88%, which means, among all loans that are predicted as to be fully paid by the model, 88% of them are actually fully paid.\n",

    "\n",
    "Calculation of loan return is very complicated since the loan is paid by monthly installments. In this project, we simplify the calculation by using the total payment and funded amount. We can use following formula to calculate the total return:\n",
    "\n",
    "$TotalReturn = \\frac{Total Payment}{Funded Amount} - 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "The total return doesn't reflect loan profitability since loans have different terms. It's more accurate to compare annual returns. There are only two terms in the dataset, 36 months and 60 months. The formula to calculate annual return is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$Annualized Return = (1+Total Return)^{(1/years)} - 1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if total return of a 36 month loan is 10%, then annualized return = `(1 + 0.1)**(1/3) - 1` = `0.032`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, this is not the true annualized return of a loan. But the goal of this project is to identify loans to invest, so we just need a benchmark to evaluate loan portfolio performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code cells, we define a function to calculate annual return of a loan portfolio. The function calculates annual return for 36 month and 60 month loans in a portfolio separately. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then we use the `get_portfolio_annual_return()` function to find out the annual returns of all 36 months and 60 months loans in the test dataset. There are 5960 36 months loans, with annual return 2.69%, and 2004 60 months loans, with annual return 2.74%.\n",

    "Comparing to the portfolio selected by rfc2, in the new portfolio, 36 months loan return drops a bit and 60 months loan return increases a bit. But the biggest impact is that in the new portfolio, there are 10 times more 36 months loans than 60 months loans. While in the dataset, the ratio is about 3 to 1. The reason is that since 36 months loans have much higher repaid rate, when we set class_weight='balanced', the model will bias toward 36 months loans."
